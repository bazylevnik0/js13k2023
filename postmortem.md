Art

Sure, using emoji is not an invention, but maybe I found something interesting: the dragon(or witch you name or interpretation you wish) in different browsers has its own face, in common -each browser has some differences in details. In js13kgames I was oriented to Chrome and Mozilla, I can say about it like an artist: in chrome they add some “magic”(details in lights, colors) in firefox it is way to simplification, maybe even a minimalism. Sure it is just my opinion. It is not only about the dragon, but about all the sets of symbols in the game… The dragon looks similar in both, looks like a very red guy(color of fire, blood).
Sure we can fall to historical/folk interpretation of the dragon, I mean is it good guy or bad guy? Who knows, maybe in this castle they burn strange girls for example… And dragon are making revolution(a partisan war) just thought, just thoughts

Coding

I repeatedly use just simple elements(UI). I devide the logic of game from elements. 
I started from ui, because it is what we play directly, hands of the game, what we touch. Then I thought about consequences of “touching” the UI, and went to the full main logic of the game(ye it also not invention and old and existing game, you can read about reference  in wiki).

It is not my first game, and I found interesting pattern in gamemaking - random numbers, for game with some generating we need it(generating is very common word) but as we know random numbers are not exist, heh. Just thinking about it when trying to test my game, because some guy or not guy(all sexes and not sexes what you can imagine) will play and will get own oriented numbers and it is really strange for me, because - how our human system works? If not any random numbers exist, so deterministic uhh.

Ah and matrices, I fall in love with arrays, it is insane - I think all things in the world possible to shape in array. I tried to escape and think about OOP or something like this, but no… Folks, I love matrices(and not trying to hide it), just put object in an array and move, shift, choose, delete, etc… Arrrrays!
